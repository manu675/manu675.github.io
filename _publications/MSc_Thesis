## **Abstract**

Smart Cities strive to leverage information and communication technologies in order to analyze
the growing amount of available data on the ecosystems of modern cities with the aim
of making central infrastructure components and services of a city more interconnected and
efficient. A key element of this is knowledge about future conditions which can be obtained
through forecasting models. The most recent developments seen in the M4 and M5 forecasting
competitions illustrate how far Machine Learning methods have evolved. Therefore, this paper
compares and contrasts established statistical forecasting models, ensemble methods as well
as recurrent neural networks with respect to point forecasts and prediction intervals. Using
publicly available high-frequency data from the New York City Open Data platform, we analyze
large univariate time series of traffic flows and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) data.
We detect multiple levels of seasonality in the high-frequency data considered in this paper,
which complicates finding suitable forecasting models. We find that recurrent neural networks
produce the most accurate point forecasts and uncertainty measures for traffic data. For the
EMS data, our results show that both recurrent neural networks and Exponential Smoothing
state space models which can account for complex seasonal patterns perform best with respect
to point forecasts, whereas the quality of the prediction intervals of the latter is the highest.
