About my personal page

I am a M.Sc. graduate from Copenhagen Business School and I am currently applying for PhD programs in Statistics and/or Data Science. 

Aside from school, I am an avid traveler, always open for meeting new people and exploring new places and I am passionate about science, technology and cars.
